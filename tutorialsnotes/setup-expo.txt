Sent by Copilot:
Certainly! To update Expo to the latest version from the command line, follow these steps:

Upgrade Expo CLI:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to update the Expo CLI globally:
npm install -g expo-cli

If youâ€™re using a Mac, you might need to run the command with sudo:
sudo npm install -g expo-cli

Upgrade Your Expo SDK:
Once you have the latest Expo CLI, navigate to your project directory (where your package.json is located).
To upgrade the Expo SDK within your project, run one of the following commands:
To install the latest SDK version:
npm install expo@latest

To install a specific SDK version (e.g., SDK 51):
npm install expo@51

Alternatively, you can use Yarn:
yarn add expo@latest
or
yarn add expo@51

Upgrade Dependencies:
After upgrading the Expo SDK, make sure to update all other dependencies in your project to match the installed SDK version:
npx expo install --fix

Read the Release Notes:
Check the SDK changelogs for the version youâ€™ve upgraded to. They contain important information about breaking changes, deprecations, and other updates that may affect your app.
Remember to test your app thoroughly after upgrading to ensure everything works as expected. Happy coding! ðŸš€

For more details, you can also refer to the official Expo documentation. ðŸ˜Š Learn more about updating Expo SDK if youâ€™re curious! ðŸ“š
